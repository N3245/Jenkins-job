1. Tell me about your experience in L2 Production Support.

Answer:

I’ve been working in L2 Production Support, focusing on Linux environments, system monitoring, incident resolution, and user support. I handle escalation from L1, work on server issues, perform root cause analysis, manage scheduled tasks via cronjobs, and monitor services using tools like Nagios/Zabbix. I’ve also worked with ticketing tools like JIRA/ServiceNow, and I’m comfortable writing shell scripts for automation or log parsing. I aim to ensure minimal downtime and proactive issue resolution.

2. How do you handle a high-priority (P1) incident in production?

Answer:

When a P1 incident occurs, I first acknowledge the alert and inform stakeholders via the designated channel (email/bridge call). I quickly gather logs and check system health (CPU, memory, disk, service status). If needed, I escalate to L3 or the application team. I keep communication clear and frequent, update the ticket with progress, and ensure a workaround or fix is applied. After resolution, I document steps and contribute to the RCA report.

3. How do you troubleshoot a Linux server that’s suddenly gone unresponsive?

Answer:

First, I try accessing the server via SSH or console. If it’s unreachable, I check network connectivity (ping, traceroute). If the server is reachable but slow, I review system performance: top, vmstat, iostat, and disk usage. I check logs (/var/log/messages, application logs) to identify the root cause. If needed, I restart services or escalate to infrastructure/network teams.

⸻

4. What steps do you take if a cron job fails?

Answer:

I’d start by checking the cron logs (/var/log/cron) and the user’s crontab. Then I verify the script or command path and its permissions. I’d manually run the script to check for runtime errors, confirm required environment variables, and review any output/error logs. Once fixed, I’d test the cronjob with a near-future schedule and monitor the next run.

MIN = Minute (0 - 59)

HOUR = Hour (0 - 23)

DOM = Day of Month (1 - 31)

MON = Month (1 - 12)

DOW = Day of Week (0 - 7) (Sunday = 0 or 7)

5. How do you manage incidents and changes in ITIL-based environments?

Answer:

I follow ITIL processes for incident, problem, and change management. For incidents, I log and categorize them, work within SLA timelines, and provide RCA if required. For change requests, I ensure they’re documented, reviewed, approved via CAB, and executed during the change window with a rollback plan in place. I update all tickets with clear documentation for audit/compliance.

⸻

6. How do you monitor your production systems and what tools have you used?

Answer:

I’ve used tools like Nagios, Zabbix, and CloudWatch for system health, disk usage, service status, and custom application metrics. I configure alerts for thresholds and use escalation rules for critical failures. I also write shell scripts to monitor specific application components not covered by default tools.

⸻

7. How do you handle user-reported issues in production?

Answer:

I respond by gathering all necessary info: user ID, exact issue, screenshots/logs if possible. I reproduce the issue if applicable, check related logs and system stats, and resolve it or escalate if it requires application/database changes. I keep the user informed throughout and document the resolution clearly in the ticket.

⸻

8. Can you explain a challenging issue you resolved in production?

Answer (example):

We once had a critical issue where a batch job was failing silently at midnight. I checked cron logs and found it triggered correctly. On further investigation, I discovered the script was failing due to a missing environment variable set only in interactive shells. I added proper environment loading in the script itself, and the issue was resolved. I documented the fix and updated team scripts to avoid recurrence.

⸻

9. How do you ensure knowledge sharing in your support team?

Answer:

I document all resolved issues in a shared knowledge base (Confluence/Wiki). For complex or recurring incidents, I create detailed runbooks or SOPs. I also conduct informal knowledge transfer sessions and encourage the team to log learnings from every P1/P2 incident.

⸻

10. Are you comfortable with on-call rotations and working in shifts?

Answer:

Yes, I’ve been part of a 24x7 on-call rotation and am comfortable working in shifts. I understand production support needs high availability and quick response times, and I plan accordingly to ensure smooth handovers and minimal disruption.
